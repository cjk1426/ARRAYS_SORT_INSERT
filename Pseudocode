1. Create an array of Stock objects
   Each stock object contains:
   - Brand
   - DateEntered
   - Status

2. Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, or Arrays.sort)
   Sort by:
   - Brand (alphabetically)
   - DateEntered (ascending order)
   - Status (On-hand/Sold)

3. Implement a search algorithm (e.g., Binary Search or Linear Search)
   Search for a specific stock by:
   - Brand name
   - Engine number

4. Print sorted array and search results

5. End
